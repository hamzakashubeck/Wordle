# Wordle
My version of Wordle coded in Java, with a simple GUI.

Files: WordleGame.java contains the main game simulation, and GUI.java holds the main code for the user interface.
solutionsBank.txt contains all potential Wordle solutions for the game to choose from, and guessableWords.txt holds all valid user guesses.

This project was good practice in using Swing to build a gui (as well as involving an ActionListener, which I had not done before), as well as managing potential errors stemming from Java IO file operations.
